# GL GPUPE
This is a proof of concept for a pixel engine I have been drafting. 
The plan is to use gfx-hal + a window framework (winit?) to build the actual engine,
I wanted to have a simpler environment to build a prototype in to get some experience first.
If the mistakes are held to a minimum I will attempt to build the high-level systems in a way so that I can simply swap out rendering and window context systems.

The draft can be found [here TODO](todo). 

# Contribution
The actual implementation will accept contribution. However, this prototype will not as it serves as a learning experience for me
